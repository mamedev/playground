CORE
-----
SDL-Specific (possibly Windows only)
Paths are not created if they do not exist
Example:  Make sure there is no snap\xevious folder
"sldmame xevious" then attempt to take a snapshot with F12
Under normal circumstances, the missing folder+file would be created but this no longer happens+file never writes.
August 16 SDLMAME Windows seems to work ok so regression is later

Suspect strongly much work done on September 13th, 2014 by Firewave merging SDL and Windows functionality.

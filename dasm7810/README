This is a quick hack 7810 command line disassembler, based on a previous work
that was part of the MAME emulator (http://www.mamedev.org/).
It should be useful for those who have to disassemble some ROM images
containing uPD7810 (NEC) opcodes.

There are only three possible (one required) command line arguments:
filename[.ext]	A filename for the file containing a ROM image
-o xxxx		A base address offset if the ROM doesn't start at 0
-r		Output relative jump addresses; do not convert to absolute

You will usually call the program like this:
	./d7810 rom7810.bin >rom7810.asm


This will redirect the output (the disassembly) into a file named rom7810.asm
which you can then load into your favourite text editor.

That's all,
have fun
